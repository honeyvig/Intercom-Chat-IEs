------------------
To implement the project described for Portlandia Electric Supply (PES) using Python, we can break down the tasks into the following key areas: platform configuration, AI-driven lead scoring and chatbots, multi-channel communication, integration with other platforms, and AI-powered reporting and predictive analytics.

Below is a Python-based approach to automate and support these tasks:
1. Platform Configuration and Role-Based Permissions

We will need a configuration system to define user roles and permissions dynamically. Here is a code outline to manage roles and permissions using Python:

class RoleBasedPermissions:
    def __init__(self):
        self.roles = {
            "SDR": ["view_leads", "qualify_leads", "chat_support"],
            "AE": ["view_deals", "close_deals", "customer_engagement"],
            "AM": ["manage_accounts", "upsell_opportunities", "customer_engagement"],
            "Support": ["view_tickets", "resolve_tickets", "customer_support"],
            "Catalog Manager": ["update_catalog", "manage_inventory"],
        }
        
    def check_permission(self, role, permission):
        if permission in self.roles.get(role, []):
            return True
        return False
    
    def assign_role(self, user, role):
        user.role = role
    
    def get_user_permissions(self, user):
        return self.roles.get(user.role, [])
    
# Example usage
class User:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.role = None

# Create user and assign role
user = User("John Doe")
rb_permissions = RoleBasedPermissions()
rb_permissions.assign_role(user, "SDR")

# Check if user can view leads
print(rb_permissions.check_permission(user.role, "view_leads"))

2. Custom Bot and NLL Integration with Lifecycle-Based Lead Scoring

Using AI and Natural Language Learning (NLL), we will build a dynamic lead qualification and scoring system based on customer interactions. Here’s an example of how to set up a basic AI-powered chatbot with lead scoring logic:

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import numpy as np

class LeadScoringAI:
    def __init__(self):
        # A simple model to predict lead score based on user interaction (could be extended with more features)
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier()
        self.train_model()
        
    def train_model(self):
        # Dummy dataset with interaction features (e.g., page views, time spent on site)
        X = np.array([[5, 2], [8, 6], [3, 1], [7, 5]])  # Features: interactions, time_spent
        y = np.array([1, 2, 0, 2])  # Labels: Lead quality (0 = low, 1 = medium, 2 = high)
        self.model.fit(X, y)
        
    def score_lead(self, interactions, time_spent):
        lead_data = np.array([[interactions, time_spent]])
        return self.model.predict(lead_data)[0]
    
# Example usage
lead_scoring_ai = LeadScoringAI()
lead_score = lead_scoring_ai.score_lead(6, 4)  # 6 interactions, 4 hours spent
print(f"Lead Score: {lead_score}")

3. Proactive Messaging and Multi-Channel Communication Setup

For proactive messaging, you can trigger messages based on customer behavior, such as visiting key product pages. Here's an outline of how you could automate proactive messages:

import random
import time

class ProactiveMessaging:
    def __init__(self):
        self.message_templates = {
            "product_page": ["Looking for more details on our products? Let us know!"],
            "pricing_page": ["Have questions about our pricing? We'd love to help!"],
        }

    def send_proactive_message(self, page_type):
        if page_type in self.message_templates:
            message = random.choice(self.message_templates[page_type])
            print(f"Sending message: {message}")
        else:
            print("No proactive message available for this page.")

# Example usage
messaging_system = ProactiveMessaging()
messaging_system.send_proactive_message("product_page")

4. Help Center and AI-Powered Ticketing System

For AI-based ticket prioritization, we can use a basic model that categorizes tickets into high, medium, or low priority based on text analysis. Here's an example of a basic ticketing system:

from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

class TicketingAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
        self.model = MultinomialNB()
        self.train_model()

    def train_model(self):
        # Example ticket descriptions and priority labels (1: High, 0: Low)
        tickets = ["System down", "Unable to login", "Pricing question", "Product inquiry"]
        labels = [1, 1, 0, 0]
        
        X = self.vectorizer.fit_transform(tickets)
        self.model.fit(X, labels)

    def predict_ticket_priority(self, ticket):
        X_new = self.vectorizer.transform([ticket])
        return self.model.predict(X_new)[0]

# Example usage
ticket_ai = TicketingAI()
ticket_priority = ticket_ai.predict_ticket_priority("System down")
print(f"Ticket priority: {'High' if ticket_priority == 1 else 'Low'}")

5. Comprehensive Integrations with Salesforce, NetSuite, Asana, and Office 365

To integrate with Salesforce, NetSuite, Asana, and Office 365, you can use the respective APIs to sync data. Here’s an outline of how an integration call might look (you’ll need API access tokens for real-world applications):

import requests

class IntegrationSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.salesforce_url = "https://api.salesforce.com"
        self.netsuite_url = "https://api.netsuite.com"
    
    def get_salesforce_data(self):
        response = requests.get(f"{self.salesforce_url}/data", headers={"Authorization": "Bearer <access_token>"})
        return response.json()

    def update_netsuite_inventory(self, product_id, stock_quantity):
        response = requests.post(f"{self.netsuite_url}/inventory", json={"product_id": product_id, "quantity": stock_quantity})
        return response.status_code

# Example usage
integration_system = IntegrationSystem()
salesforce_data = integration_system.get_salesforce_data()
print(salesforce_data)

6. AI-Driven Drip Campaigns and Lifecycle-Specific Nurturing Sequences

The campaigns can be adaptive, sending emails or messages based on lifecycle stages. The following is a simplified example of sending emails based on lead score:

class DripCampaign:
    def __init__(self):
        self.campaign_templates = {
            "high": "Thank you for your interest, let's discuss further!",
            "medium": "Here's more information about our offerings.",
            "low": "Would you like to schedule a demo?"
        }

    def send_campaign(self, lead_score):
        if lead_score == 2:
            print(self.campaign_templates["high"])
        elif lead_score == 1:
            print(self.campaign_templates["medium"])
        else:
            print(self.campaign_templates["low"])

# Example usage
drip_campaign = DripCampaign()
drip_campaign.send_campaign(2)

7. Custom Dashboards and Reporting with AI-Enhanced Analytics

Using Python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, or pandas, you can visualize KPIs and metrics. Here’s a simple example of how to track customer engagement:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class ReportingSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {
            "leads": [100, 150, 200, 250],
            "sales": [50, 75, 100, 125],
        }

    def plot_metrics(self):
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        ax.plot(self.data["leads"], label="Leads")
        ax.plot(self.data["sales"], label="Sales")
        ax.set_xlabel("Time (Months)")
        ax.set_ylabel("Count")
        ax.legend()
        plt.show()

# Example usage
reporting_system = ReportingSystem()
reporting_system.plot_metrics()

8. Predictive Insights, NLL Applications, and Long-Term Account Management

Predictive insights can be based on historical data patterns, such as identifying churn risk or upsell opportunities. Here’s a simple predictive model using logistic regression:

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import numpy as np

class PredictiveInsights:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = LogisticRegression()
        self.train_model()

    def train_model(self):
        # Example data: interactions and satisfaction score to predict retention
        X = np.array([[5, 8], [10, 6], [2, 9], [7, 4]])  # Features: interactions, satisfaction
        y = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0])  # Labels: retention (1: retained, 0: churned)
        self.model.fit(X, y)

    def predict_retention(self, interactions, satisfaction):
        return self.model.predict([[interactions, satisfaction]])[0]

# Example usage
predictive_system = PredictiveInsights()
retention_status = predictive_system.predict_retention(6, 7)
print(f"Retention Status: {'Retained' if retention_status == 1 else 'Churned'}")

Final Thoughts

These Python code snippets form a foundational implementation of various aspects of your Intercom project. In practice, these components would be more sophisticated, including error handling, integration with databases, secure authentication for APIs, and advanced AI models. Each deliverable would need to be expanded with proper data integration, error handling, and performance optimization to align with PES's objectives and tech stack.
